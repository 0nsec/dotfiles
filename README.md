# To be Noted 
- [Everblush](https://github.com/mangeshrex/everblush.vim) is a dark and beautiful colorscheme which I've used in my latest rice. 
- I use bspwm as my daily life window manager bcuz its super minimal and fill my needs. 
- I mostly use Nerd Font, Here - CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font Mono.
- For GTK3 I use my custom [Everblush theme](https://github.com/mangeshrex/everblush-gtk) made with Phocus/gtk3. Also you might need to modify the theme according to your preference ^-^ 
- I use [Conscious](https://github.com/Manas140/Conscious) for neovim, I mostly swap between whenever I get bored (Both the themes have Everblush Support).
- I am using tint2 as my default bar in bspwm (friendship ends with polybar ;-;). 
- My Old nord Dotfiles can be found in the [nord branch](https://github.com/Mangeshrex/dotfiles/tree/nord) of this repository.
