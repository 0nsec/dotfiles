# Bspwm-Dots 
This repo of my dotfiles containing all the cli-tools or apps I use. 

#To be Noted 
- The Above Image has my latest setup of ArchLinux Bspwm. 
- Install All the Below Listed Polybar fonts. 
- Do not forget to configure your Workspace Names in polybar if you want the workspace name on the bar. 
  That can be changed in your bspwmrc `bspc monitor -d 1 2 3 4 5` at this line. 
- Here I used Kitty as my default terminal emulator. 
- Color scheme : Nord with some variations. 
- You need to edit some values like in the bar like wlan or monitor or some other things. 
- Also to note in the polybar menu module I have my name in Japanese you can change that to anything you want or maybe icon.
